# µ10 Keyboard

Here you will find all the source files I used to build my µ10 (aka Micro10) keyboard.  Here's a list of features

* 10u wide QAZ-ish layout
* Supports a 10u spacebar
* Designed to be wireless (via nice!nano + ZMK)
* Option daughterboard for OLED and rotary encoder
* PCB uses Kailh hot swap sockets
* PCB supports a 1.25u modifiers on each end if shorter/split spacebar is utilized.  Requires the case to be redesigned.
